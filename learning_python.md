# Learning Python
## Part 1
This part covers python basics, you should be familiar with variables, functions, modules & classes

Feel free to read on the subjects on the internet - **Don't look up algorithms**
1. **Factorial** - Write a recursive function to calculate a factorial of a number
2. **Anagram** - Write a function that checks if two strings are anagrams of each other
3. **Pancake Sort** - Write a function to sort an array of integers. Use the `pancake sort` algorithm 
4. **Remove Duplicates** - Write a function that removes duplicate characters from a string
5. **Permutation** - Write a recursive function that prints all the permutations of the set {1...n}
6. **Highest Occurred Character** - Write a function that returns the highest occurred character in a string
## Part 2
This part covers slightly more complex exercises. Feel free to use libraries. Use proper OOP

Here, you should be familiar with design principles, SOLID & design patterns

In addition, you need to be familiar with APIs, HTTP and REST.
### FTP Server
1. **Python Accessibility** - Write a simple FTP server, accessible via python code (no need for an HTTP API or a CLI). The server should allow getting the files on the server, getting a specific file, storing a new file
2. **REST API** - Expose the functionality through a REST API (use a library of your choice). Should expose a /files endpoint with support for POST, GET, DELETE, PUT
### Coronavirus Collisions
1. Write a RESTful API that allows:
- CRUD for people that tested positive for the virus (POST, GET, DELETE, PUT)
- Given a location, check if you should be in isolation
2. Allow live updates. Using a techonology of your choice, allow getting updates from the server about new infected location and times, so you can know ASAP if you should be isolated.
